The student management system is a comprehensive application developed using Java's object-oriented programming principles, MySQL for data storage, GitHub for version control, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction. It aims to efficiently manage and organize student-related information and projects.

The system allows users to perform various tasks, including adding, editing, and deleting student records. Each student entry includes essential details such as name, ID, contact information, and enrollment status. The system ensures data integrity and validity by implementing validation checks during data entry.

To enhance collaboration and version control, the system integrates with GitHub. It creates a dedicated repository for each project, facilitating team members to collaborate and share code efficiently. The system handles the synchronization between the local project files and the remote GitHub repository, ensuring version control and enabling easy rollbacks or updates.

The graphical user interface provides an intuitive and user-friendly environment for users to interact with the system. It incorporates input forms, tables, and buttons for seamless data entry, display, and manipulation. The GUI allows users to navigate through student records, add or edit information, and view project details effortlessly.

Overall, the student management system streamlines administrative tasks, simplifies project management, and enhances collaboration among students and instructors. It leverages object-oriented programming concepts, MySQL for data storage, GitHub for version control, and a user-friendly GUI to provide a comprehensive solution for effective student management.
